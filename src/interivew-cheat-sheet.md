# Cheat sheet
============================================================

## At Introduction
- Ask if they can hear me okay

## Before Coding
0. Breathe
1. Listen carefully
  - Re-explain the problem back
  - Ask clarifying questions
2. Write down (new) examples/test cases
3. Brute force
  - Think about the problem naively
  - State a brute force solution and its time and space complexity
  - (Brute force solution should not be my final solution)
4. Optimal
  - Think about the problem more deeply/cleverly
  - Draw example
  - Be vocal/speak up if I get stuck. Ask for hints.
5. Get "sign-off" on the interviewer before starting to code

## While Coding
- Write pseudo-code first
- Share reasoning/discuss trade-offs
- Be vocal/speak up if I get stuck. Ask for hints.
- Write beautiful, modular code

## After Coding
- Conceptual test (walk-through)
  - Make sure everything looks beautiful and is modular
  - Fix bugs carefully
- Special cases and edge cases

# Other notes
============================================================
- Target medium-level problems on Leet Code in 20-25 minutes

# Methods
============================================================
- BUD (bottle-necks, unnecessary work, duplicated work)
- Simplify & Generalize (solve a simpler version)
- Base Case & Build (solve for the base cases then build from there)
- Data Structure Brainstorm (try various data structures)
